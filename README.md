Difficulties: 
Working with node was definitely hard and learning CRUD 

My thought process was that I needed to do some sort of onClick functions to each set of 
buttons to perform a process (add, edit, save, and delete). This was by far the hardest project that I worked on because of the logic. It didn't make sense at first because I to start from 
scratch 5 times before I landed on a product that I liked and that I could understand. I wanted
to go above and beyond and use a database so that I can get a feel for what it feels like using a 
database. In my opinion it was definitely easier to use a database because of the mongo module 
functions that I was able to use.
